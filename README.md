# Credit_Risk_Analysis

### Challenge Overview 
In this challenge it applies with machine learning models to predicting credit card risk. This is useful for determing whether someone is considered a good candidate for a possible loan that could benefit and lead them to lower rates. 


The machine learning models that were adopted were:
* Random Over Sampler 
* SMOTE Oversampling 
* Cluster Centroids Undersampling 
* SMOTEENN (Over and Under) Sampling 
* Easy Ensemble ADABoost Classifier 
* Balanced Random Forest Classifier

Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk

Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis 

### Resources 
* Data Source: LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.9, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Conda 4.8.4, Jupyter Notebook

The balanced accuracy score is 63%

The high_risk precision is about 1% only with 62% sensitivity which makes a F1 of 2% only.

Due to the high number of the low_risk population, its precision is almost 100% with a sensitivity of 68%
